# Data Visualization in Pandas Using Airbnb Rentals Data

Airbnb makes much of their data publicly available and available for examination under a Creative Commons License. Download the listings.csv
file (summary information and metrics) for Nashville, TN for August 16, 2018 from [this link](http://insideairbnb.com/get-thedata.html) and load it into Pandas.

In this Jupyter notebook, I created three diferent visualizations. 
1. Number of reviews vs. price for the data set

2. A bar chart that shows the number of rental units (both private rooms and entire home/apts) by district
(“neighbourhood”)

3. A scatter plot that shows, plotted by latitude and longitude, airbnb rentals in the Nashville area. Private rooms and entire home/apts are distinguished by color.
